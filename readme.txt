## How Lead Generation Form works?

Go to the plugin dashboard and click on 'Create New Form' or go directly to the 'Form Generator' menu.
First, type a name for your form.
Use the fields menu on the right sidebar to drag and drop the fields you want into your form.
Configure each field's settings, such as whether it's required, its label, help text (tooltip), placeholder text, class, name, value, and type.
Make sure to add a single Submit button to the form.
Once you've finished building the form, click the "Save Form" button.
This will save your form and generate a shortcode for it.
Copy the shortcode, which will look like [WLFG id='7'], and paste it into a new page or post to display your form.
